In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

- Logistic regression model shows 99% accuracy.
- Low risk loans 100% precision & High-risk loans 84% precision
- Low risk loans 99% recall & High-risk loans 94% recall




















* Machine Learning Model 2: Random Over Sample

- Random Over sample model shows 99% accuracy.
- Low risk loans 100% precision & High-risk loans 84% precision
- Low risk loans 99% recall & High-risk loans 99% recall








## Summary

Although both models provide great insights, the random over sample would be the best model to use. It has the best accuracy, precision, and recall overall. The random over sample would produce the best results to ensure loans are given to the best applicants.
